# Coding Challenge Web Frontend (React.js)

Dear hiring student,

you can proudly claim you reached level 2 in the hiring process of becoming a 
**Tenderframe** developer. That being said, we would like to see some convincing code in order to
evaluate your programming skills. Nothing too fancy, don't invest more time than you are willing to.

The evaluation of the submitted result will be based on the following criteria:
* how have you organized your commits (don't use one bulk commit at the end of the development, use meaningful commit 
messages for your growing codebase that show us that you work in a structured manner)
* how are you managing to work with a package manager (`npm`) and third-party packages
* how are your components and your code structured (HOC vs functional components, folder/file structure, etc.)
* how much are you committed to clean code and good-practice programming patterns

If you cannot relate to all of the above mentioned points don't be afraid. The coding challenge can be solved  
by all developing levels from junior to senior level! We will evaluate based on *your* particular skill level.

So, ready? Here are the tasks finally.

## Tasks
1. Setup up a create-react-app boilerplate (Dificulty: ★☆☆☆☆)
